Evo AI is a strategy game that has a pretty similar scheme as the board game, Splendor. 
The game simulates the evolution of computing based machines. Players will try to evolve as fast as possible with limited resources to win the game. 
The game intends to let players have fun while pondering the past and the future of technology and the human role in the part of evolution. 
In this project, there are two players competing and achieving either getting enough victory points or building a singularity machine first to win the game. 
There will be a full structure and functional game being presented in this stage of development.
